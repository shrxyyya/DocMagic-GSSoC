3. **Fork the repository**: Create your own fork to work in
4. **Create a branch**: Use a descriptive branch name

### Pull Request Process

#### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DocMagic.git
cd DocMagic

# Add the original repository as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Xenonesis/DocMagic.git
```

#### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- `feature/feature-name` for new features
- `fix/bug-description` for bug fixes

- Include password hashing
- Add user session management

Fixes #123"
```

**Commit message format:**
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

- Include a blank line before the body
- Reference issues and pull requests when relevant
- Use bullet points for multiple changes

#### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push your branch to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request through GitHub's interface.

## 🎯 Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

```typescript
// Use descriptive names
const generateResumeContent = async (userInput: ResumeInput) => {
  // Implementation
};

// Prefer interfaces for object types
interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

// Use proper error handling
try {
  const result = await apiCall();
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  console.error('API call failed:', error);
  throw new Error('Failed to process request');
}
```

### React Component Guidelines

```tsx
// Use functional components with TypeScript
interface ButtonProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onClick: () => void;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
}

export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ 
  children, 
  onClick, 
  variant = 'primary' 
}) => {
  return (
    <button 
      className={`btn btn-${variant}`}
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
